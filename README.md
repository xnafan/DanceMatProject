# DanceMatProject
C# library for communicating with a USB dance mat using .NET

## Short description
This project includes 
 * C# class library for communicating with a USB dance mat
 * Console tester project, to illustrate how simple it is to communicate with a USB dance mat (a oneliner)
 * Windows Forms dance mat visualizer project, which shows which buttons on the mat are currently activated
 * Small maze game, which allows the player to move around a randomly generated maze top down
 * An actual dance game, with steps incoming from the bottom (Dance Dance Revolution - style, but much simpler)
